                Analog HD is so surreal, idk how to put it in words. Its like I'be been transported back there vividly,
                mostly because of the high definition that it is recorded in. 
                The video feels like something that should be in a timecapsule that we send to the next zoinkgflorp 
                that lives in the Milky Way.

                It feels even more unreal when you see stuff from that time in such high quality as it kinda just... idk melts my brain.
                Maybe this will be how when AI starts creating even better videos. 
                Since it would look so surreal that our brains would trip and we would all be flabbergasted.  
                I wonder how video editors feel about all of this, well ig I would know how they feel since I am an artist.
                <br/><br/>
                I guess that's one problem with AI at the moment, it can't really provide something truly human without humans
                (oh wow who would have thought 1s and 0s cant create something human, silly adeo). 
                It is vital to understand it can simply only be a tool at its current state. 
                I do think that, further down the line, 
                AI will be able to generate things that are indistinguishable from human generated things 
                due to the sheer amount of work we put out.  
                <br/><br/>
                Ironic as it is, the more we create, the more we approach the time where there is no reason to create.
                When I say creating I don't mean we won't create anything ever, 
                but that there will be a time where nothing is created by humans or at least a very small amount.
                After all, why go through all that labour to actualise your dreams when something else can do it for you?

                Now I wonder how the people back in those analog videos thought about the future.
                Did any of them even know that later on 1080p videos would be commonplace?
                They probably did honestly, back then we were imagining flying cars and all sort of things that don't make sense.
                Stuff like the things you would see in sci-fi flicks and the sort.

                Maybe we are too optimistic about the future and we should be more realistic in our predictions. 
                After all, it is a little disappointing that we don't have flying cars yet.
                Or maybe we should go forth with that optimism and strive to create more things, 
                pushing the boundaries of what is possible? 
                To the point that it's still a marvel in the future how it was possible in that era.
                Just like how they did with these analog HD videos in the 90s...
                I think you know which one is the best option moving forward.:)
