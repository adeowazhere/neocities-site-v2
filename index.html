                    <b>halli hallo</b>, this is adeo! this is another rendition of my personal website 
                    since i didn't like the layout as I was compensating for mobile devices a lil too much...
                    I made this as a way to get to know me and also as a way for me to say silly things lol,
                    I hope you enjoy your time here! <em>(and the inconsistent capitalisation)</em> :D<br/>
