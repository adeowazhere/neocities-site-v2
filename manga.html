                    No lengthy synopsises because idk they kinda suck the feelin' out of a story ya hear?

                    Alot of these stories mean alot to me and it would be amazing if you checked them out,

            <h3>Shiori Experience</h3>
            <section>
                <img src="/images/shiori_experience.png">
                <p>
                    Shiori Experience is a manga that <i>should</i> be hella weird, 
                    it has <b>JIMI FLIPPING HENDRIX</b> as a ghost following the main character for god's sake.
                    But its a nice story about doing what <b><i>you</i></b> want to do.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It follows a teacher who wants to play in a band like their old school days,
                    but their older brother kinda screwed up his music career so the family is like <i>'nuh uh!!!!'</i>.
                    But she does it anyways, facing a lot of band challenges with her student club.
                    And the manga is ongoing but so far Shiori's band is pretty successful :D.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This manga is kinda personal to me tbh.
                    I even named my laptop after the Black Bus, all it needs now is a nice fat Black Bus sticker!!! 
                </p>

            <h3>Suicide Girl</h3>
            <section>
                <p>
                    <strong><i>tw: suicide</i></strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    THIS MANGA IS ACTUALLY ANTI-SUICIDE AND IS UPLIFTING!
                    Just want to make sure that we all are not judging a book by its cover <i>(more so its title)</i>.
                    The manga is basically about whipping suicide's ass but with magical girls which is so <i>raw</i>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It does also talk on some topics like bereavement, 
                    since the MC fights because they dont want to lose someone else to suicide, and yk obviously suicide as well.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Also, abooouuutt that uplifting tone, it <i>kinda</i> takes a nose dive into a tragedy story around <b>chapter 26</b>, 
                    but it seems like it will get resolved into a happy ending (i hope :/).
                    <br/><br/>
                    <i><strong>So don't read it if you are already in a low period of your life rn.</strong></i>
                </p>

            <h3>Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun</h3>
            <section>
                <img src="/images/iruma_kun.png">
                <p>
                    This is the most feel good shonen ever, its like 50 times sweeter than toffee and I love it for that.
                    It has shonen stuff like battle and etc but damn is this so wholesome. 
                    Every time I see Iruma, Clara or Asmodeus dopamine is released in abundance.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It follows Iruma, who is sold by <b>HIS PARENTS</b> to a demon
                    <i>(off to a wonderful start aren't you Iruma).</i>
                    The demon takes him in as his son in a world full of demons that hunger for human flesh.
                    He keeps his true identity a secret and goes through demon school life making plenty of friends <i>somehow...</i>
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you can't tell by now i love feel-good and uplifting stories, 
                    they give you a fresh lens view life :).
